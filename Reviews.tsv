Outstanding.... Bought this phone for my father and he is much happy with the product as it doesn't heats up under moderate use. Only con so far is the battery life about 32 hrs under moderate use conditions.	3456	756	0.820512821	1	1	1	1	0

"I purchased the 64 gb varient and I'm reviewing it after a few days usage. The battery back up of good and lasts for 1.5-2 days on normal usage. I played a couple of games and found no lags. The front camera is nice and clicks good selfies. The main camera is good however the low light performance is not good. The pictures slightly distort when clicked in low light conditions. When you zoom in the image clicked on low lights, you can see the pixels breaking up. The phone performance and ram management is good and the multitasking works perfectly fine. I feel the size is slightly bigger to fit in your pocket. Especially if you wear jeans or tight clothes and keep your phone in pocket, I would not recommend this phone. The display looks good and the in hand feel of the phone is nice. Overall it's a good deal in this price segment. Please give me thumbs up if you find this review helpful. Thank you!"	721	169	0.81011236	1	1	1	1	0

"The first thing i liked on this phone is the display wuth its 18:9 body ratio which will give great video viewing feel. Build quality is good and the back body is metalic but its kind of slippery so a back case provided by xiomi really felt useful. Miui is a great custom skin over android it has some great handy features. Battery backup is pretty good, for me its giving me a full day of battery life & in normal usage im getting 1.5 days. Charging time is between 2 hours. The led notification colour is only white no multi colour led. From a week of usage the didnt got heated even in heavy usage or charging. Overal a great value for money"	46	7	0.867924528	1	1	1	1	0

"Reviewing after 1 month of usage.I have tried to cover every aspects. My review may seem a bit cluttered as I have mixed the pros and cons. So kindly read the whole review. Let's start:- Packaging= Neat packaging by Xiaomi. Inside the box you get the phone itself , black colour translucent back cover , manual , charger , micro usb cable and sim ejector tool. Display= Only thing I can say about the display is ""crisp"". 18:9 aspect ratio looks wonderful and feels like you are holding a high end smart phone Battery= I was using a Lenovo vibe P1 earlier which had a 5000 mah battery and lasted more than 1 and half-day. So I was a bit skeptical about the battery life , as this phone is having a 4000 mah battery. But , it really surprised me. Lasts for about 30hrs with casual usage and with heavy usage it lasts for a day. Sadly Xiaomi haven't included a fast charger which is very disappointing as this phone supports QC 2.0 , If you want one then check in the MI app. Camera= Isn't the best around in its segment. Gets the same cameras as that of the RN4 with some improvements. I feel it could have been way more better. I would say it's ""ok"". Front camera lacks quality and the rear camera performs good in the daylight. However , both the cameras (front and rear) doesn't clicks good quality picture in artificial/indoor lighting.Totally not recommended for camera/selfie lovers. Performance= The Snapdragon 625 has become quite old now and should have been replaced with the newer ones (Atleast with the 626). But that doesn't means it is a bad processor. Thanks to the 4 GB ram , the doesn't exhibit any lag at all. Gaming performance is descent enough. I have played asphalt 8(high graphics) , dead trigger 2 and gangster Vegas on it. No lags , no frame drops. Handles well and the phone doesn't gets much heated. Build quality= Seems good. I personally feel it isn't very durable as it is very sleek and the display looks very very fragile.The case included with the box will not provide any protection from accidental drops.It will just protect the phone's back from getting scratches and will offer some grip. I strongly recommend you to buy a bumper case and a tempered glass. Sensors= Has almost all the sensors one could aspire for in a mid-range phone. Except NFC. UI= MIUI is very engaging , uber responsive and butter smooth. It is one of the main reason for the smooth and lag free experience. However, there is a lot of bloatware. Some of which can be removed. Verdict= Go for it if you are a casual user who doesn't takes much pictures and want a ideal phone. I would say it is a value for money composition. Have a nice day."		9	0	0	0	0	0	0

"Writing a review on my first Redmi phone.I have bought my Redmi Note 5 on a flash sale and my first impression was with the quick delivery. I am from Kochi, Kerala and I ordered the product on Thursday noon and the phone got delivered on Saturday morning. Even though I was double minded whether to buy this phone or Mi A1 (Coz I was a stock android user before), I finally decided to buy this phone. I was waiting for giving a review on this and I have listed some. Here it goes. Pros :1. Very smooth and faster performance 2. Battery backup is so great. You will get one day backup if u use internet continuously, and if you don't, you will get around 2 days backup. 3. The full screen display and the Full HD + gives you a great experience of watching videos, photos and more. 4. A great phone on this budget and its worth for it. 5. Even though I have seen many negative reviews on camera, I really liked this one. This 12 MP gives me great pictures. (I was a 5 MP camera user, now that's great right?) Cons :1. The 5.9 inch screen was my first bad impression of this phone as i was a 4.5 inch screen user before. It was not handy at the begining but I am used to it now. Still the size is a drawback for me. 2. Pre installed MI apps that cannot be deleted or disabled. It takes a lot of space  3. Will add more once I get more. Final Verdict : Go get your Redmi Note 5 now and if you are a great mobile photographer and wishes to buy dual camera phone, then you can go for Redmi Note 5 Pro. I am happy using this phone PS. I am hereby attaching some images I captured with Redmi Note 5"	29	8	0.783783784	1	1	1	0	0

"My 1st Redmi Mobile: Note 5 4Gb RAM/64GB model is A Cut above the rest. This is my first Mobile in Redmi Brand. Although I neither saw nor used my hands-on experience with it's predecessor (Redmi Note 4). I used Asus Zenfone 5 for 3.5 years nearly, which was fine initially but used to give out multiple technical glitches - heating up battery, Not able to retrieve any of OTP SMS in case of Mobile Recharge, When I used 3G, battery consumption was almost like Slurping your favorite juice too quickly.. Soon my contacts in Phone App weren't shown up, even if I had to reboot the device for 5-10 times. If lucky with seeing my Contacts, the Battery would get compromised and fall from 100% to 25 % in matter of 20 mins. But on Redmi Note 5 - No such issues..since a week's time. For me the vantage point is I couldn't have gotten the satisfaction, if I had gone for 5000mah ranged mobiles. I liked Big screen, Options for capturing screenshots, User Interface and utmost is No fuss about Heating up battery when I used 3G/4G beyond 25 mins.. 12MP camera is quite satisfactory to me. Hardly, I took any selfies during all these years of using smartphones..Would have been more awesome for a 20+ and 13 Mega pixel range of Rear/Front combination along with 5000mAh battery to make it A cut above the competitors. Overall, I'd rate 4.95 out of 5"	48	5	0.905660377	1	1	1	1	1

There are many customers who had same problem and their phone was new. i cared my phone very much and I never use phone during rain so how it happened. I called customer care also and told about cheating happened with me but they did not helped me. They said that you have to pay for repair your phone.

Superb in all departments and addition of 18:9 bezel. And at wat wat price.Battery, camera, processing speed and memory size. All at par. Only sad story is the sale part.

Delivery though was late by 1 day. But Thanks Xiaomi and Flipkart who managed to give me this smartphone in that flash sale. An excellent communication skills was provided by flipkart customer care and their services. Im really satisfied with their behaviour and my feedback for them is very good. Thanks Team Flipkart for making it possible. And talking about the phone. Its too smooth to handle. The blue variant of mine is liked by all and mee too. And No doubt its INDIA'S ALL ROUNDER.

"(CONS/DEFECTS FOUND) 1. IF YOUR PHONE SCREEN IS ON, From the earpiece you will hear a strange buzz noise (coming out of it).Its present in both the devices{RN5 & RN5 Pro}. It can only be heard when you keep close your ear to the earpiece(as a calling posture). Why guys?? why this issue. It was also present in REDMI 3s Versions. and now again. 2. Camera is VERY VERY BAD. At daylight u will get good pics(not that sharp compared to RN4) but in low light conditions it sucks. Noise Level is so high... the 5 MP camera looks like VGA quality. 3. Battery backup not good after the update. it hardly lasts in 4G connectivity. That all..On the other hand: (PROS) good display, good viewing angles, good speaker output, call quality is good, touch response is average, UI looks awsome, RAM Management is Good. Games runs smooth without lag but in GTA Sandreas(game) i found some little frame drops at highest quality. Other games like Asphalt 8, NFS Most wanted, MC5, etc...runs good. OVERALL REVIEW IS THAT ITS NOT A GOOD ALL ROUNDER AS IT MENTIONED. ITS STILL HAVE BUGS/ISSUES/QUALITY ISSUES...Wish it would be fixed by software updates in the near future."	29	41	0.414285714	0	0	0	0	0

"Let me provide you my whole experience, 1. Product Delievery (9/10): Ordered on Wednesday, delievered on Friday in nice package. 2. Design (9/10): Black one looks great, even better than what is shown in photos. But compared to its rival, Realme 1 looks even better. 4. Performance (10/10): I am heavy game user and so far so good. 5. Battery (10/10): Its battery is a Beast! I have used Sony, Oppo phones of 20K-25K price range but its battery performance beats them up clearly. For normal usage, It can easily run along with you for an entire day. For gamers, You can easily use it for 6-8 hours without any interruption. 5. Camera (10/10): Though, I haven't experimented in many different light conditions but camera gives up excellent quality in proper light and great in low light as well. 3. UI & Display (10/10): I bet its display is best. When you use other phones for 4-5 hours continuously (If you're game addict like me), you have possibly sore eyes. But its display is way more comfirtable and superior, if set with proper brightness. Talking about MIUI, this OS is very user friendly as well. 6. Price (10/10): Nothing to say about it. 7. Speakers (9/10): I don't use them often but they are satisfactory. Overall, the product is superb . Though, it is my first MI phone I'm in love using my phone. Hope it helps"	2	0	1	1	1	1	1	1

"After using smartphones from 3 different brands , Here is what I have to say about Mi phones - 1) No doubt Mi phones have great specification. The price is quite cheap as compared to any other smartphone brand 2) Mi phones are quite fragile and have poor build quality. It would break quite easily 3) Battery starts to drain very sharply after 1 year of usage. Overall, if you can buy a premium smartphone like OnePlus go for that. Don't waste money on buying cheap quality products every year."	2	1	0.666666667	1	1	0	0	0

"This is an amazing phone..trust me..this is coming from someone who spend 60k on Samsung note 4 when it was launched ..after rigourously using S note 4, it gave up on me after 2 years and I was forced to buy a new phone..I mustered enough courage to but One plus 5T ...but was not quite content for the price I paid and ended up selling it off in a matter of 2 months ..I bought MI NOTE 5 out paucity of cash..but never have I been so happy..this phone gives me all that i got in one plus 5t..more or less..the front camera is much better.. my friends envy me when I shot better photos with note 5 wherein their One plus 6 failed..even Samsung A5 couldn't deliver the quality that this phone offers..only minor drawback is that under low light conditions, the photos captured are not quite promising unless you have steady hands.. otherwise worth every penny..guys please go for pro..it's even better..MI rocks big time ..:)slim design and good camera with good battery backup"	3	0	1	1	1	1	1	1

The intention was to use as a secondary phone but due to its performance this is my first phone now. Great speed, amazing display and awesome battery. Real cool performance review system too where Mi found out that my alarm has an issue and it debugged the issue and informed me. Great phone you can buy for this price.

Xiaomi Redmi note 5 same as note 4 no upgrade only the display ratio has been changed same chipset same processor same gpu same ram everything is same even the same camera atleast the Camera should have been improved The next redmi always gets popular due to better specs but to make more profit they have launched the note 5 pro which supposed to be the redmi note 5 now they have the highest sales they are into business now see what real me 1 will do in my opinion real me 1 will overtake every phone market support the better one not the smarter one	4	1	0.8	1	1	1	1	0

"The product offered in the price range is awesome.}The clock speed is more than Redmi Note 5pro(1.8 GHz) which can be clearly observed(2.0 GHz).}The camera is not perfect but is ok for normal usage.} The best part is battery, charges really fast & 10hr of continous calling reduces only 18%.} Performance undoubtedly is great.} The design and built is nice fits perfectly for single hand use.} Noise cancellation is gr8 and works fine in high disturbance also.} As a whole divice is nice bundle, can be chosen if camera is not priority. Best part is don't have to wait for flash sale etc. etc. , it's easily available"	5	1	0.833333333	1	1	1	1	0

Really happy to have bought Redmi Note 5 as it is the best model in the budget range. The mobile even though is 5.99 size it is very slim and make it handy and do not have a feel of carrying big mobile. The camera is good for this price range. Battery backup is more than 1 day. Value for money. and the design is slim and easy to fit in pocket bt not good for rough use it is a bit delicate and screen can easily get crack bt overall features are nice	6	1	0.857142857	1	1	1	1	0

"First of all if your budget is around 12k then don't buy this one instead go for Redmi note 5 pro because this one(Redmi note 5) doesn't have face unlock ,dual camera but if your budget is under 10k then go for it. Its display is very good big,crisp and sharp and it doesn't feel very big in hand. The phone is very slim,build quality is very good all metal except at the top and bottom for antennas. Overall the phone is very good under 10k to 11k as the procesor is very fast in this price range it doesn't lag.battery backup is good. Rear camera clicks sharp images under good lighting but if the light is bit low then images get shaky. the camera is bulging out of the body so extra care needs to be taken. Xiaomi is also giving a nice back cover nowadays whose quality and finishing is very good. I would say that if your budget ia under 10 k then go for it otherwise go Redmi note 5 pro."	9	1	0.9	1	1	1	1	1

"Hello viewers, I am glad to give my review that's it first ever phone who has good battery backup. It has 4000mAH battery and charges within just one hour. It's has powerful Snapdragon 625 octacore 2.4 GHz processer which will make your phone hang free. And talking about display..its so natural looks like you are seeing images on paper it has very high pixel density with gorilla glass with Big FHD 5.9"" display. About camera rear has 12 MP and front 5 MP are good enough to capture high quality images.A nd good thing it has dual in color back flash and front party flash. The GUI offerd by MI is superb.I am damn sure you never get bore with your phone like stock androids phone. But it have just one drawback. it has not crystal quality sound but it's OK. Just one more I have to add in future please give it with Dolby Atmos with theatre max experience..Then MI will boom in smartphone."	2	0	1	1	1	1	1	1
"Bought for 10799 using HDFC credit card during Big Shopping days. Got the phone delivered by the next day without even paying any extra, super fast delivery from Flipkart and its logistics partner ekart. PROS: 1.wonderful display and cool UI. 2. No need to buy the back case as the case is given for free and good for grip. 3. 2A charger, not the fastest but fast, It should take 2 hours for a full charge but did not take that much time. 4. Speaker is good with good sound output and quality. The positioning of speaker good as the sound is loud when we place mobile in the pocket. 5. Internal memory 64gb is great, In fact, I don't need that much. My previous mobile had 16 GB+16GB and I never exceeded storing 20 GB. 6. Better optimization better between hardware and software as it consumes less power and does not get heat up. 7. Loving the front flash, It helps the poor front camera to take really great pictures in dark conditions. 8. Super Fast finger-print sensor. CONS: 1. Very less Antutu benchmark score after the update. 2.Ads in the MIUI and preinstalled bloatware. 3. Performance dropped after the update..... 4. Nougat is good but Oreo had been better. 5. Mobile has 4gb ram but performance drops when using more than 3 GB of ram. 6. Missing frames(little) in playing games especially pubg, but still can enjoy playing. 7. Poor cameras, especially under low light conditions. I literally cant see anything on the screen while recording a slow-motion video at night. 8.Not dual 4g enabled, one simslot is for 4g and another 3g. 9. Not a con of mobile, but the full-screen view and split screen are useless for the apps I love to use. It would have been great if it had: 1. Type C port 2. Dual camera or at least software enabled bokeh effect with the camera app. 3. Newer processor like SD636. will update more after a month of usage."	25	2	0.925925926	1	1	1	1	1

i would say the phone is okayish.. I have been using Moto G5s+ and i bought this phone for my sister coz she like the 18:9 aspect ratio. when the phone came i tested just 2 things and i can say my moto g5s plus is better than redmi note 5. 1) This phone lost to my g5s+ in speed test.. even when this phone was freshly out of the box and my moto was 60% storage used. 2) I clicked few pictures and my moto had stunning sharpness and this had poor sharpness.. However.. Low light photography is impressive. Value for money definitely but this phone is meant for moderate users only who don't do much with there phone.	2	0	1	1	1	1	1	1
I bought this phone as a gift for my sister The phone is value for money . The camera is fairly good if you dont want an excessive zoom in on while taking a snap shot the front camera is good for video calling The display is of excellemt quality believe me i have been an aplle user right from 4s to i phone x and i can stil say for sure the display is as good as i phone x If you are not looking for a hefty price tag or an apple logo to flash around and impress others which believe me doesnt happen these days this phone is worth buying The battery quality is good The only flaw i found is the size of the phone which is a bit big but then again hey its not that big that cant be kept in jeans pocket (pocket of shirt may be an issue) Interface of the phone is plain and quite same as of any android the sound quality for stereophone isnt that great But all in all I guess this phone has pretty much everything we need in a smart phone I will say if you arent very particular about the brand this is a fair phone to buy I wish i hadnt bought my i phone X	9	1	0.9	1	1	1	1	1

"So here's my review. Tried for Note 5 pro for 4 weeks couldn't get it. I wanted it because of higher processor,dual rear camera,front 20MP flash cam but had to settle for note 5.But Note 5 is good if not awesome.The pros which i could mention are not about the specifications because you can find them on the website but my usage pros.My god this phone is slim and good at hand.I was afraid of 6 inch mobiles as they have risk of looking like tablets but this one piece is a magic in hand.I hate back covers for mobile as they increase the thickness but even with back cover this is slimmer than a lot of nonsense mobiles out there.The camera is good and will do. 4k recording capable. Coming to color again i had to settle for gold as nothing was available but again i was shocked to see the piece in original as it is lot more beautiful than all the pictures available. Coming to battery my previous phone( asus zenfone 2) which was a huge disaster and i thought not to buy flagship phones in budget as screen blinkering problem after 4 months,battery disaster if used lightly battery lasting 9 hours if used heavily lasting 3 hours and if left unused 12 hours what a nonsense and then i got note 5 woow using heavily from past 24 hours but this battery still at 37% i am really in love and feels now i have a real smartphone which could last also The phone dosent have any useless apps but comes with inbuilt useful apps such as screen recorder. I was thinking i will use this phone until i get hold of redmi note 5 pro and sell this piece for lower amount to someone else but oh boy this phone got my heart. Finally i would simply say i love this phone"	12	1	0.923076923	1	1	1	1	1

I receive first phone that was faulty volume button not working properly but seller give me replacement and I say this is nice device and I give 5 star for that replacement. 2-3 time I receive faulty product but each time Flipkart give me the replacement for that very honestly. I love Flipkart this is my favourite e commerce site. Talking about device the device working perfectly still I use and give you update about that.battery is very nice.smooth gaming better than note 5 pro because note 5 pro battery backup is not good SD 636 is not battery ifficient processer. SD 625 is old but still is gold 10000 varient is value for money. I highly recommended this for gaming and battery backup.4000mah battery is tank and this battery is better than note 5 pro and note 4 as I see a video on YouTube.mi use SD 625 in note 5 again because this is battery ifficient processer as I say again and again.you dont believe me so you watch geeky Ranjit's note 5 and note 5 pro video .

I was earlier using gionee which is of 1GB Ram so i wanted to boost upto. 3GB or 4 GB ram mobile... I was in dilemma for purchasing mobile... I was confused between motog5 plus and honor... Finally thought of going with redmi 5A which is worth for money.... Suddenly found this awesome mobile launched... Then checked its features it was comparatively good with motog5 plus.... Some of my frienda got motog5 plus in clearance sale which had heating issue... So decided to go with this. Camera way far good... 8/10 good thing is even at low battery flash works Front camera 8/10 Battery 10/10 as this one stands for 2 days with full internet usage... Earlier my gionee would at the end of the day.... You guys can imagine i watched a entire movie when it was just 13% aand still it spared charge for me... Performane- top class.. 9/10 I installed around 60+ apps to check if it hangs.... None i faced so far Screen clarity- 9/10 best as I have stopped uaing my tablet for watching videos... Full screen mode gives you a great feel Sound clarity-8/10.. It is excellent when on head phones... When on speaker... You will feel some noise for intense musics Touch-9/10 Smooth and silk And rich features of mi 9.5 is good... Added features like screen recording with sound helps me record live matches... Movies... Videos... Music... That is wow And google assisstant has made my work so easy and hassle free Rich notes with features of adding photos and much more is one great usage for me Split screen option is good as the screen size is bigger... Overall it is 9/10 worth for money If you are in oscillation go for it guys... It is best in market I am ordering one more in next sale Note: kindly buy a shock proof case if your handling is hard...i have dropped it 3 times but no issues working fine.... Loving it guys	2	0	1	1	1	1	1	1

"Amazing smartphone at the 12K price segment. I know RN5 Pro is better but this is not bad either. I was out of cellphone, so was need it badly, though attempted three flash sales to get RN5 Pro, didn't get so opted out and got this RN5. As of now, no lagging or heating issue if you throw anything on it. RAM management has been improved a lot. UI is fast and lag free, though, Initially felt lagging but after 1.5GB Update, it butterly smooth..... If you can afford waiting and can bear months of flash sales then go for Pro variant, else go for RN5, which is not a bad option at all even if you are multitasker and gamer like me...... Hope this helps.... I used RN3 for the past two years, comparing that: this is far better, display, UI, RAM management, etc etc.......slim phone full on battery backup"	14	1	0.933333333	1	1	1	1	1

Excellent product for its time. Loved the features that it provides for the price. The processor is quite fast and works like a charm. Camera is very good and even the display is quite good. Loved the finish of the product and it looks good especially the gold variant. Used it for 3 years before it was stolen. Upgrade to the latest model from the Redmi series but it is a good series and one can trust a product from this line-up.snapdragon 	3	0	1	1	1	1	1	1

There are many customers who had same problem and their phone was new. i cared my phone very much and I never use phone during rain so how it happened.

"First of all,value for money product. Using this for few days PROS: Spectacular Display Single hand use is easier than i expected since its a gigantic six inch display.But the cover they gave us free is a bit slippery (good quality material though) Better battery perfomance Engaging UI: everything you want to do is right there and tweak/clean apps already there Great signal reception Speaker is loud enough Makes some rattling noise when i play 128kbps files,but thats normal right? Charging time is quite fast Doesnt heat up that fast.I can not say its stays cool everytime.on warmer days,heat dissipation is slower,yet comparatively better to other xiaomi phones I've seen Multitasking is hassle free with this phone Ram management going great after the first update CONS: Camera isnt that nice,but good enough for this price range.Struggles in low light,color reproduction is just OK, Larger pixel size seems to be doing nothing. picture output is exactly same as note 4  Although battery perfomance is great,it consumes little extra when phone is idle Some may find the tallness a bit difficult to handle.If you ride a bike and this device is in your pocket it will constantly give you a fear of snapping At the first boot there will be only 1.7-1.8 gb ram availabe for use.But after updating to miui 9.5,it wiil improve a lot There was some fractin of a secend freezing in some screen before the update,but none seen after that The data speed monitor isn't real time,they may fix it later after some ota updates  I've seen some toast notifications in Chinese Only android 7.0 ou of the box,but thats a minor concern,the update will roll out in mid julyBuy a good hard case.phone is slippery and the glass edges tent to break within an average dropI WILL UPDATE ONCE AGAIN AFTER FINISHING FIRST MONTH *update*Used about 10 days Heats up when charging battery consumption in idle mode is high *update* phone is hot as hell while charging Battery draining little fast I installed 39 apps ( counted before writing this review ) So a pretty good amount of apps running in background , I am a heavy user and in an average day there is lots of fb,instagram feed scrolling,hours in messengers, large deal of netflix streaming,gaming for a while ( only one,shooting balls to destroy blocks thing ) and in a day like that with full time data on,i got 8.5 hr screen on time before dropped to 5%.Actually i was a bit concerned about my battery life,but after writing this i understood battery is coping great with me Its been two months and 5 system updates Draining and heating problem is pretty non existent now. Glad xiaomi giving updates regularly. The data speed monitor issue is still not resolved TIP : 3G data connection makes this phone lot warmer. I was using 3g data instead of 4G. Switched to 4G lately,my phone never heated eversince "	15	1	0.9375	1	1	1	1	1

"I brought this device 10 months before.Now there is a problem for network.When I asked this problem to the customer care,they told me that it is due to liquid problem.I am sure that from my hands it doesn't touch a drop of water.They are not providing any Warrenty regarding to this problem.I always used backcover with it.Then why they are producing this type of phone which cannot withstand a little of moisture.Very sad about the condition of the phone."	4	1	0.8	1	1	1	1	0
"i Bought Redmi Note 5 (Gold, 64 GB) from Flipkart on Jun 23rd '18. Less than six months i am having a display problem. i get a yellow display on right side of the phone. This is clearly a manufacturing defect of the display screen. I Bought it for ??1,999 and very disappointed with quality. very poor product. No value for money. When i call Redmi service center in Chennai i got a very poor reply. I feel I am cheated."	5	1	0.833333333	1	1	1	1	0
